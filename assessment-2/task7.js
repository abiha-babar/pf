/*Suppose an employee gets paid every two weeks and earns Rs. 5700.00 each pay period. In a year the employee gets paid 26 times.
 Write a program that defines the following variables:

payAmount: This variable will hold the amount of pay the employee earns each pay period. Initialize the variable with 5700.00.
payPeriods: This variable will hold the number of pay periods in a year. Initialize the variable with 26.
annualPay: This variable will hold the employee's total annual pay, which will be calculated.
The program should calculate the employee's total annual pay by multiplying the employee's pay amount by the number of pay periods in a year,
 and store the result in the annualPay variable. Display the total annual pay on the screen.*/
 

let payAmount = 5700.00;
let payPeriods = 26;
let annualPay = payAmount * payPeriods;
console.log("TOTAL ANNUAL PAY :::  ", annualPay);
