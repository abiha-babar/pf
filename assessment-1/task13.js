/*To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up and then divide the sum by the number of values. 
Write a complete program that stores the following values in five different variables: 28, 32, 37, 24 and 33. 
The program should first calculate the sum of these five number and then stores then in a different variable named sum. 
Then the program should display the average on screen. [Use data types correctly*/

let [a,b,c,d,e] = [28,32,37,24,33];
sum = a + b + c + d + e ;
totalnumber = 5;
average = sum / totalnumber;
console.log (sum);
console.log(average);
